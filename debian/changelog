pyfll (1.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Add minimal ./debian/* infrastructure to source tree for archival and
    copyright purposes.
  * Adapt fll.py to python2.5, which has try, except, finally blocks.
  * Word wrap de/fll.8.txt to sane 80 character per line.
  * Use partition string method of python2.5 to determine pathnames inside of
    a build chroot.
  * Update README file to indicate current minimum requirements.
  * No longer explicitly rebuild the initramfs for installed kernels.
  * Write /etc/default/distro configuration file before installation of
    package so that the live initramfs may be preseeded correctly.
  * Support trivial repositories when repo config section contains the
    'trivial' keyword set to any value at all.
  * Add insserv.postinst to activate startpar concurrency when insserv is
    used.
  * Add wacom-tools to xserver package module.

  * add/replace gtk-qt-engine and kde-style-domino to appropriate pkg lists  
  * revert accidental commit of my temp pkg changes 

  [ Ferdinand Thommes ]

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * try to save 10 MB in kde-seminarix.

  * wengophone isn't installable these days.
  * bump standards version to 3.8.0, no changes necessary.
  * add xserver-xorg-video-openchrome to xserver task.
  * fix Uploaders syntax.
  * don't show unionfs alternatives for now, it conflicts with aufs.
  * remove no longer existing packages:
    - fujiplay (Closes: #476780).
    - screenkast (Closes: #482978).
  * add skeleton for sanity.postinst to give the installed package lists some
    sanity checks against misbehaving packages.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * remove wmauda (dock remote control for audacious) to keep audacious out of
    xfce - audacious has a new (hours old) bug where it segfaults on start
      - aqualung is left as the default music player
