  * NOT RELEASED YET

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * disable totally broken hplip.
  * add virtualbox-ose-guest-utils to amd64 builds, virtualbox-ose 2.x claims 
    to cope with amd64 guests, in case hardware virtualisation is available.
  * hpilp should be installable again.
  * remove tvtime and kdetv, there are no analogue senders in germany or the 
    US anymore.
  * #517884 is fixed in Debian, remove the locale generation workaround again.
  * remove get-kde4-pinning.sh, debian-qt-kde has switched to git and KDE4 is 
    on the doorstep to sid anyways.
  * dump kde4 preferences for apt, kde4 is in sid now, rendering this obsolete.
  * kdeservicemenus are not more, remove them.
  * merge kde4-essential into kde-essential.
  * remove powersaved and switch to acpi-support-base.

    doesn't work.

    inline with kde-lite

  [ Kel Modderman ]

  [ Bernard Gray ]

  * Add support for grub2 as live media bootloader.
  * More cupsys -> cups package name changes (cups-driver-gutenprint).

  * Drop ttf-liberation per default, it seem to render poorly in
    mozilla.
  * Add feh so that fluxbox can set a background.

    what mechanism should be used for starting the bluetooth services,
    udev-config-sidux seems to also provide one.
  * Add bluez-utils and bluez-pcmcia-support to hwsupport-extra package
    module.
  * Whitelist bluz-utils initscripts again.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * add xfce4-session to recommends handling, primarily to pull in dbus-x11

  * icedtea-gcjwebplugin has finally hit main.
  * drop lilo, it's implicitly conflicting with grub and about to be dropped 
    post-lenny.
  * remove FileType preconfiguration from vimrc.local, it's erroring out.
  * add zenity to XFCE.

    through startsyslog indirectly.

  * disable kvm for the time being.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * move hplip-gui to kde-desktop - it pulls in 88MB qt libs, tx ModestUser

   - this is useful for kde4 testing, and is ignored if commented
  * add commented debian-experimental repo section as example for kde4 testing

  [ Joaquim Boura ]
  * splited xfce into xfce and xfce-lite.
  * use xarchiver instead of thunar-archive-plugin as this needs ark or 
    file-roller.

  [ Ferdinand Thommes ]
  * add foo2zjs for HP Printers

  * partial revert 18631 - domino -> qtcurve
  * update hwsupport-printscan for cupsys -> cups transition
   From 1.3.7-6 changelog:
