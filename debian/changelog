pyfll (1.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Add minimal ./debian/* infrastructure to source tree for archival and
    copyright purposes.
  * Adapt fll.py to python2.5, which has try, except, finally blocks.
  * Word wrap de/fll.8.txt to sane 80 character per line.
  * Use partition string method of python2.5 to determine pathnames inside of
    a build chroot.
  * Update README file to indicate current minimum requirements.
  * No longer explicitly rebuild the initramfs for installed kernels.
  * Write /etc/default/distro configuration file before installation of
    package so that the live initramfs may be preseeded correctly.
  * Support trivial repositories when repo config section contains the
    'trivial' keyword set to any value at all.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * kcalc (desktop calulator) should be a core kde utility, moved to kde-basic
  * xfce needs a desktop calculator, add gcalctool
