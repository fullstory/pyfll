pyfll (2008.04) 2008-04; urgency=low

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Merge insserv and its postinst into essential and its postinst, thus
    preparing is a new system default.
  * Make cli.postinst path agnostic when checking for availability of
    programs.
  * Avoid the use of os.access, use stat and bitwise comparison instead.
  * Add console-setup to essential, and aim to have it provide system
    defaults for keyboard settings in future.
  * Update data/fll_sqfs_exclusion for change in name of udev persistent
    rules locations.
  * Clean up arch staging method a bit.
  * Use a generic writeBootldr() method which calls grub, yaboot or future
    alternatives as needed.
  * Add hal-cups-utils to hwsupport-printscan package module, it helps to
    automatically prepare printers for use without manual admin configuration.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * re- enable kvm for kde-full and dvd.
  * add foo2zjs to printscan.
  * remove rcconf, it simply does more harm than good.
  * revert locale preseed hack (r20659), glibc 2.7-16 should be fixed.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * temporarily re-add contrib/preferences for kde4 builds
    - the dynamically generating script is not working because
      some packages have moved from exp to sid, specifically
      phonon, libphonon4, libsoprano*
  * remove automoc and libphonon-dev from kde4 preferences
  * remove libqimageblitz-* from kde4 preferences
  * fix non-existant openoffice.org package profile specified in lxde
  * fix audacious plugins typo in lxde

  [ Joaquim Boura ]
  * added stanza for lxde
  * moved fluxbox and feh to a own set
  * removed feh from utils-x
  * added keyboard layout switcher (thks mzilikazi)

  [ Niall Walsh ]
  * Add python-gobject to packages.d/hwsupport-printscan to make the supplies
    work in hplip.
  * Only setup update-grub in kernel-img.conf if grub is installed.
  * Allow vmlinux as kernel image.
  * Use usr/lib/grub to control the staging of grub files and hence creation
    of live grub config.
  * Use usr/lib/yaboot/yaboot to control staging of yaboot and hence creation
    of live yaboot config.
  * Only enable genisoimage related boot options if grub is instealled.
  * xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse, xserver-xorg-video-openchrome, grub-gfxboot,
    gfxboot-theme-sidux and acpid are i386 and amd64 only.
  * Add yaboot to powerpc essential packages.
  * Allow single or multiple kernels in config.
  * try to mimic debian-cd setup for powerpc genisoimage options.

  [ Michael Deelwater ]
  * fll.py:
    - add -k/--hashkey <key id> option
    - signs MD5 and SHA256 hashes if key is available
  * fll.py:
    - do not try to chown a non-existing signature
  * packages/packages.d/essential.postinst:
    - write locales_to_generate in /etc/locale.gen and call locale-gen;
      provisional fix
  * LXDE:
    - Add lite and full LXDE package lists.
    - Let distro-lxde use desktop-defaults-lxde and the Ourea GDM theme. There
      is no sidux-art-lxde, yet.
    - Add lxde-lite package profile.

  [ Horst Tritremmel ]
  * install-meta removed from distro-tools-x.
    it's not the best for a out-dated rolling release distro

pyfll (2008.03) ourea; urgency=low

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Modify past and current changelog entries to use date release code for
    version number.
  * Add screen to initscript whitelist.
  * Add support for grub2 as live media bootloader.
  * More cupsys -> cups package name changes (cups-driver-gutenprint).
  * Use a common timestamp for iso name and /etc/distro-version of all chroots
    contained on iso. The timestamp is taken from moment of invocation of
    build process.
  * Add info to command line utility line-up.
  * Add FLL_DISTRO_URL to distro-defaults section of default build config.
  * Add aspell and i18n entry. It is used by various desktop apps
    (eg. xchat, kmail).
  * Put en_AU in i18n list.
  * Drop ttf-bitstream-vera from xserver package module, our desktop settings
    use ttf-dejavu now.
  * Add autoindent option to vimrc.local configuration created by
    cli.postinst.
  * When disabling bitmap font, use a relative symlink rather than an
    absolute one.
  * ttf-liberation should encompass all of what ttf-freefont provided,
    therefore remove ttf-freefont as it is no longer required.
  * Uncomment xserver-xorg-video-openchrome and give it some exposure.
  * Drop ttf-liberation per default, it seem to render poorly in
    mozilla.
  * Add feh so that fluxbox can set a background.
  * Remove bluez-utils from data/fll_init_whitelist, it is not clear
    what mechanism should be used for starting the bluetooth services,
    udev-config-sidux seems to also provide one.
  * Add bluez-utils and bluez-pcmcia-support to hwsupport-extra package
    module.
  * Whitelist bluz-utils initscripts again.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * add xfce4-session to recommends handling, primarily to pull in dbus-x11
    for XFCE builds.
  * add kopete to recommends handling to support SSL connections.
  * remove xchat-systray from xfce, as both provide systray icons, thanks to
    towo.
  * add default user to vboxusers.
  * replace ktorrent by ktorrent2.2 for kde-desktop (kde3).
  * add openjdk-6.
  * adapt example config to not use "sidux" as distro name.

  * tweak pinning whitelist.
  * switch pinning whitelist to blacklist.
  * fix anchor package for kde(4)-l10n.
  * add fll-live-initscripts to automatic recommends handling, required for
    liveapt.
  * give gtk-qt-engine the boot from the dvd profile, it's broken.
  * add netbase to automatic recommends handling, we need to keep ifupdown - 
    hard dependency or not.
  * icedtea-gcjwebplugin has finally hit main.
  * drop lilo, it's implicitly conflicting with grub and about to be dropped 
    post-lenny.
  * remove FileType preconfiguration from vimrc.local, it's erroring out.
  * add zenity to XFCE.
  * add utils-x to xfce-lite.
  * depend pm syslog dæmon (rsyslog) directly, instead of pulling it in 
    through startsyslog indirectly.
  * add kvm support and the userspace tools to kde-full.
  * disable kvm for the time being.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * move hplip-gui to kde-desktop - it pulls in 88MB qt libs, tx ModestUser
  * patch to allow for an apt_preferences fll.conf var for custom apt-pinning
   - this is useful for kde4 testing, and is ignored if commented
  * add commented debian-experimental repo section as example for kde4 testing
  * add contrib dir including valid apt preferences file for kde4 testing
  * add kde4-lite and associated package profile for kde4 testing
  * update apt-pin preferences to handle kde4 full metapackage
  * add kde4-full and associated package lists
  * adjust default fll.conf to use ourea wallpaper
  * replace non-existent sidux-art-gnome with sidux-art-xfce for distr-xfce 

  [ Niall Walsh ]
  * use ['packages']['lang'] to generate a list of packages required
    per lang and an on-cd debian package repo with them for liveapt.
  * dvb-utils replaced by dvb-apps
  * add on-cd repo packages to the manifest (binary and source)
  * add packagesearch to builds with qt4
  * do not try to find i18n packages for the country part of a locale
  * do try and find i18n packages for the non-hyphenated locale (e.g. ptbr)

  [ Joaquim Boura ]
  * splited xfce into xfce and xfce-lite.
  * use xarchiver instead of thunar-archive-plugin as this needs ark or 
    file-roller.

  [ Ferdinand Thommes ]
  * add foo2zjs for HP Printers

  * Word wrap de/fll.8.txt to sane 80 character per line.
  * Use partition string method of python2.5 to determine pathnames inside of
    a build chroot.
  * Update README file to indicate current minimum requirements.
  * No longer explicitly rebuild the initramfs for installed kernels.
  * Write /etc/default/distro configuration file before installation of
    package so that the live initramfs may be preseeded correctly.
  * Support trivial repositories when repo config section contains the
    'trivial' keyword set to any value at all.
  * Add insserv.postinst to activate startpar concurrency when insserv is
    used.
  * Add wacom-tools to xserver package module.
  * Drop update-menus from xserver.postinst, dpkg-trigger now takes care of
    it.
  * Update fll_init_whitelist for cupsys -> cups rename.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * kcalc (desktop calulator) should be a core kde utility, moved to kde-basic

  * add/replace gtk-qt-engine and kde-style-domino to appropriate pkg lists  
  * revert accidental commit of my temp pkg changes 
  * remove wmauda (dock remote control for audacious) to keep audacious out of
    xfce - audacious has a new (hours old) bug where it segfaults on start
      - aqualung is left as the default music player
  * partial revert 18631 - domino -> qtcurve
  * update hwsupport-printscan for cupsys -> cups transition
   From 1.3.7-6 changelog:
   "Rename the package to cups. This is the proper upstream name. Upstream has

    violation." -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>
