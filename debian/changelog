  * drop kexec for the time being, it doesn't update the current kernel
    anymore.

    qemu-system-x86 only on x86 systems.

  * exclude init, sysvinit/ sysvinit-core and include systemd-sysv for
    cdebootstrap.
  * truncate /etc/machine-id to zero byte instead of excluding it. A zero-byte
    file is handled specially by systemd and regenerates a fresh machine-id
    while booting.
