  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]

    xserver-xorg-input-all for jessie.

    xserver-xorg-video-qxl, these are now provided by xserver-xorg-driver-all.
  * add qemu-system-x86 to automatic recommends handling, install
    qemu-system-x86 only on x86 systems.
  * s/kdemultimedia-kio-plugins/kio-audiocd/
  * s/ttf-dejavu-core/fonts-dejavu-core/

  * isohybrid: adapt geometry for ISOs larger than 1 GB.
  * drop install-usb-gui for the time being.

  * switch to plymouth ("details" theme) for console multiplexing.
  * improve grub2 preseeding for the installed system.
  * drop unused FLL_DISTRO_URL variable.
  * drop ntpdate, systemd-timedated takes over the common cases - tlsdate is a
    better choice for the uncommon ones.
  * switch to http.debian.net as GeoMirror.
  * convert to machine readable copyright.
  * add kio-mtp to kde-basic (kde-lite/ kde-full).

  * s/gstreamer0.10/gstreamer1.0/.
  * drop kio-mtp, it's no longer necessary with KDE5/ dolphin 15.08.x
    (kio-extras taking over that aspect for KDE5 based applications).
  * kde-desktop: add plasma-systray-legacy to help hplip-gui staying legacy.
  * move iceweasel to utils-x, in order to get it pulled into all
    profiles >= lite, as konqueror can't really be considered to be an option
    anymore; kde-stripped keeps excluding it.
  * packages.d/firmware: update to recent package reshuffling.
  * s/myspell/hunspell/.
    being, as they haven't been fixed for KDE4 for several months.
  * disable xfce4-volumed, it's no longer available.
  * add initial lxqt-stripped and lxqt-lite profiles.
  * s/xchat/hexchat/.
  * lxqt/lxde: use lightdm as display-manager.
  * prevent gnupg v1 from getting pulled into the ISO.
  * gnome-desktop: disable f-spot and epiphany-extensions.
  * add apt-transport-https.
  * s/kgamma/kgamma5/.

  * drop nbd support for the time being.
  * fix F.U.L.L.S.T.O.R.Y. homepage URL.
  * s/epdfview/mupdf/.
  * add thermald, which improves the cpufreq scaling on pstate enabled CPUs.
  * ensure that the target directory exists, before trying to write a file
    from pyfll.
  * no longer clobber /etc/network/interfaces, ifupdown >= 0.7.50 takes care
    of creating a loopback interface in the absence of an explicit
    configuration stanza for lo and the default template is sufficient for
    Ceni.
  * fluxbox: add a simple x-terminal-emulator, rxvt-unicode-lite.
  * minimal-x: add slim as display manager.
  * add xserver-xorg-input-all and xserver-xorg-video-all to the automated
    recommends handling.
  * hwsupport-extra: drop libc6-686, it has been merged into the generic libc6
    package with Debian having started to become 686+ based.
  * s/gcalctool/gnome-calculator/.
  * xfce-desktop-min: drop no longer existing xfce4-artwork
  * drop plasma-systray-legacy, no longer necessary for KDE5.
  * kde-essential: add plasma-integration.
  * drop konq-plugins, konqueror has become unsuitable as a webbrower, so
    adding lipstick via even more broken plugins won't make a difference.
  * kde-stripped: add qupzilla to supersede konqueror.
  * distro-lxqt: add desktop-defaults-lxqt.
  * distro-gnome: add desktop-defaults-gnome.
  * drop support for razorqt, upstream merged into LXQt.
  * ovmf has finally been liberated, add it to qemu shipping profiles.
  * drop kdepim-kresources.
  * there's only one desktop-defaults (left).
  * add dependencies lost in prior desktop-defaults refactoring explicitly.
  * lxde-basic: add lxde-common as explicit dependency.
  * gnupg 2.1.14-5 switched over to gpg2, adapt pyfll accordingly.
  * s/ksnapshot/kde-spectacle/.
  * vimrc.local: update and ignore new upstream defaults.
  * lxqt-essential: add qterminal.
  * distro-tools-x: add crudini, a simple python based tool to modify ini-style
    configuration files.
  * s/qupzilla/firefox/, qupzilla hasn't only now become the 400 MB gorilla in
    the operating room, it's also still just as bad as before.
  * include f2fs-tools.
  * lxqt-essential: no longer include the lxqt metapackage. lxqt 15 introduces
    a hard dependency on cmst/ connman, whose installation terminates and
    breaks existing network connections. The new hard dependency on pulseaudio
    is likewise an unwarranted addition.
  * temporarily disable foomatic-db-gutenprint (ongoing transition conflicting
    with iijs)
  * invoke apt-get update with --allow-insecure-repositories when fetching
    potentially required additional archive-keyrings, thanks to DonKult for
    the help.
  * drop kppp, removed from Debian.
  * drop khelpcenter4, removed from Debian.
  * drop apt-transport-https, removed from Debian (feature integrated into
    apt).
  * drop lxqt-common, removed from Debian.
  * update copyright info
  * evince-gtk no longer exists, switch to evince.
  * add nvme-cli, to give further management capabilities for NVME drives.

    a build chroot.

  * Add insserv.postinst to activate startpar concurrency when insserv is
    used.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * kcalc (desktop calulator) should be a core kde utility, moved to kde-basic

  * add/replace gtk-qt-engine and kde-style-domino to appropriate pkg lists
  * revert accidental commit of my temp pkg changes

  * partial revert 18631 - domino -> qtcurve
  * update hwsupport-printscan for cupsys -> cups transition
   From 1.3.7-6 changelog:

    made it clear that the usual distro patches are not a trademark
    violation." -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>
